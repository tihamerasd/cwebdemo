1) a. Compile wolfSSL with  ./configure --enable-pwdbased --enable-des3, run
      'make', and then install by typing 'sudo make install'.
   b. In the crypto/pkcs12 directory run the Makefile by typing 'make'.
2)  run the excecutable as follows:

        ./pkcs12-example

3)  Running 'make clean' will delete the excecutable as well as any created
